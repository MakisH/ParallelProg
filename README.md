# ParallelProg
Material from the TUM CSE Parallel Programming course, SS 2014-15.

Here you can find, mainly, my short presentation "Energy Efficiency and Optimization for Supercomputers"
and my solutions for the tutorial exercises.

I have all these here because I like sharing knowledge. If you found my material helpful, I invite you to
also share yours! :-)

Also, if you find any bug or you have a suggestion, I would be glad to hear!
